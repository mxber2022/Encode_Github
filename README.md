# AI-Powered GitHub Project Analyzer and Funding DAO

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered agent designed to analyze GitHub projects, assess their potential, and promote them on social media while enabling decentralized funding via a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The AI analyzes repository metrics, code quality, and community engagement, and generates detailed reports. It automatically tweets about promising projects and helps to raise funds through smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **GitHub Project Analysis:** Uses AI/ML to analyze repository data such as commits, issues, pull requests, and community activity.
- **AI-Powered Code & Engagement Review:** Leverages pre-trained models like CodeBERT and GPT to assess code quality, project documentation, and community participation.
- **Twitter Bot Integration:** Automatically posts Twitter updates for highlighted projects, helping them gain visibility.
- **Decentralized Crowdfunding:** Implements a DAO with governance tokens to allow the community to vote on projects and allocate funds based on voting results.
- **Transparent Fund Distribution:** Smart contracts ensure that funds are distributed to projects fairly and transparently.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, GitHub API
- **AI Models:** HuggingFace Transformers (GPT, CodeBERT)
- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ethereum, Hardhat
- **DAO & Governance:** OpenZeppelin, EVM Smart Contracts
- **Social Media Integration:** Twitter API

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching:** The agent collects project data from GitHub (commits, stars, issues, etc.) using GitHub's API.
2. **AI Analysis:** The AI models analyze the project for quality, engagement, and potential.
3. **Promotion:** The agent generates promotional tweets summarizing the project's strengths and posts them automatically to Twitter.
4. **Funding Governance:** A DAO allows the community to vote on which projects should receive funding based on AI analysis.
5. **Crowdfunding:** Smart contracts handle decentralized crowdfunding and release funds based on project progress.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- Python (>=3.8)
- MetaMask (for DAO interaction)
- Ethereum Wallet (for testing DAO smart contracts)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-github-analyzer.git
   cd ai-github-analyzer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Backend dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env` files for API keys:

   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub API
   - `TWITTER_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_API_SECRET`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` for Twitter API
   - `INFURA_API_KEY` for Ethereum interaction

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

5. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

### Usage

1. **Project Analysis:** The backend automatically fetches GitHub project data and runs AI analysis.
2. **Funding:** Use the frontend to browse analyzed projects, vote in the DAO, and fund your preferred projects.
3. **Twitter Bot:** The bot tweets the results of analysis and funding on your behalf.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and GitHub Data Fetching

- [x] Set up the GitHub API integration to fetch repository data.
- [x] Implement Python scripts to collect commit, issue, and star data.
- [x] Store data in a local database for further analysis.

### Phase 2: AI Model Integration for Analysis

- [x] Integrate AI models (GPT, CodeBERT) to analyze code quality and community engagement.
- [ ] Build a pipeline to rate projects based on historical success factors.
- [ ] Train custom models to predict the likelihood of project success.

### Phase 3: Twitter Bot Integration

- [x] Create a Twitter bot to post automated summaries of promising projects.
- [ ] Automate tweeting on a set schedule or when new projects pass the quality threshold.

### Phase 4: DAO Smart Contract Development

- [x] Build DAO smart contracts using Solidity to allow token-based voting and governance.
- [ ] Test DAO contracts on Ethereum testnets (Rinkeby, Sepolia).
- [ ] Deploy smart contracts on the mainnet.

### Phase 5: Crowdfunding and Fund Distribution

- [x] Build crowdfunding smart contracts for decentralized funding.
- [ ] Implement milestone-based funding release to ensure project progress.
- [ ] Build a community dashboard to track project performance and funding status.

### Phase 6: Frontend and User Interface

- [x] Create a React frontend for project discovery, voting, and crowdfunding.
- [ ] Display AI analysis results and project summaries.
- [ ] Allow users to participate in DAO voting and track funding rounds.

### Phase 7: Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integrate more social media platforms for cross-promotion.
- [ ] Add more AI metrics (e.g., security analysis, dependency management insights).
- [ ] Support multi-chain DAOs (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana).
- [ ] Add leaderboard and gamification features for top contributors.
